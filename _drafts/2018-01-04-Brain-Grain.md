After my endeavor into the machine learning world began, I became curious about my brain and its working. There are some of the things I would like to note down:

- How mind is able to recall past memories when anything related reappears?
  Maybe, when it goes to store information about this new thing, it goes to place near that memory. This suggest some tree kind of structure. For example, ask your brain about something (ball-dance maybe). Your brain will always produce some images and when you ponder deep enough, you'll realize that these images are from your past
- How memory is allocated into brain? Is it divided into categories and some fixed space is allocated to it? 
- Food for thought: Our brain is evolved through ages. It is my belief that it is ideal. If the brain is so perfect than why we cannot selectively delete memory from brain? Or maybe this is so becauseof its storage structure. It is not possible to delete it.
- Obs: When I see a blurred image, I got disturbed. My mind recognize that image is blur and adjust eye's focal length
  * How does it recognize?
  * Sometimes, I think that using spectacles is not the correct way. When you use spectacles, you are telling your eyes to adjust its focal length. It's a permanent trap. Is it bound to increase your power. Point is in no way, it's going to decrease your power.

- Blurring of memory: Sometimes, we feel that this thing has happened before (de-ja-vu). Sometimes, we feel like we have seen this person somewhere. What is this concept of blurring of memory? AFAIK, all the technology we have today is based on binary. Whether data is present or not present. But in our brain, data is slightly present, we slightly remember things. Why? It looks some kind of similarity based setting, some kind of probability shit

- Power of Evolution:
- After some time into preparing for GRE, i started getting some sort of intuition about the meanings of the words. It's like I just know somehow, don't ask how, just trust me <smirk>. 

I can add studies and relevant finding regarding these questions later
