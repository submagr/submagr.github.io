India is a big country. Take anything related to India: number of languages spoken, types of religions practised, types of climate zones or types of ethnic cuisines, you are bound to be flabbergasted by the sheer volume of diversity present in it. (That is why the tagline of Indian Tourism is “Incred!ble India” :P ). With so much diversity present, sometimes the belief of one group becomes a threat for the other which makes it difficult for the government to maintain peace in the country. I think, that is the reason why, children are taught about the values of brotherhood among all Indians from the Kinder garden (KG) itself. 

This advocacy of “Unity in Diversity” might be able to work for children but it, sure as hell, does not work for adults because, let’s face it, children are malleable, adults are not. Among these pool of diversities, I think, the topic of religion is the biggest differentiator and the main divide is between the two leading religions in India, namely Hinduism and Islam. These days, I am observing that one particular question regarding this topic, that is quite frequently occurring as a part of daily conversations is, “Whether India is going to become a Muslim nation?” It may not seem as a big question from a person’s point of view who lacks historical knowledge about India, but it is an important one, particularly, among the Hindus living in the country. Maybe, Hindu people think that if Muslims equal Hindu population, they will start performing atrocities against Hindus and will destroy Hindu religion because Muslims want only their religion to prosper (like the radical terrorists of IS, Taliban etc.) and Hindus are always the victims. I, myself, have been a part of many conversations revolving around this question and these discussions always ended in a “ये तो होना ही है..!” (It is bound to happen..!). Sometimes people talked about some religious organisation’s rant [8] about rising Muslim and decreasing Hindu population in India but without any hard numbers or true statistics, sometimes about the hate speeches of some politicians and sometimes people just assumed it to be true. I, on the other hand, was mostly on the side of “नही” (No) as an answer but always lacked facts to bolster my case. 

So, I thought that it was about time to look at some numbers and settle this question once and for all (at least from my side :P )

### Numbers 
At first, let’s look at the decade-wise trend of Hindu and Muslim population after Indian independence:

{% include 2017-12-25/T1.html %}
Table 1: Census data of Indian Population distribution based on religion[1]
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 90%; text-align: center;"}

Anybody can see the decrease in Hindu population and increase in the Muslim population by just having a look at this table. It’s so obvious, right?

<strong>WRONG</strong>
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Table 1 just shows the proportion of Hindus and Muslims in Indian population and not the absolute number of people of these communities. Since the total Indian population is increasing over the decades, the number of people in these communities is also increasing.

{% include 2017-12-25/T2.html %}
Table 2: Religion-wise numbers of people in India since independence 
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 90%; text-align: center;"}

Looking at Table 2, it can be concluded that population of both communities has increased in each decade after independence. So, the myth that “Hindus are decreasing in India” can be easily shattered down here by Table 2.

<strong>FIRST MYTH BUSTED …!!!</strong>
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Also, by combining the data of Table 1 and Table 2, the relative rate of population growth of both communities can be seen below:

Graph 1: Decade-wise increase rate of Hindu and Muslim population
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 90%; text-align: center;"}

First of all, it can be seen that the growth rates remain the same during 1961-71and 1971-81. The reason for this observation may lie in the emergency period of 1975-77 [10] when people were forcefully sterilized by the government. Since emergency is a big topic in itself, let’s try to be focussed on the topic in hand, where, from the above graph, it can be inferred that the growth rate of Muslims is greater than Hindus. So, this means, if this trend continues, both communities are bound to become equal in population in future. So, let’s try to find a cross-over point when Hindu and Muslim population will become equal.

For this, I am going to assume that total Indian population is going to grow at its current rate of around 17% per decade. Now, as it can be seen that, both Hindu and Muslim population growth rate are decreasing with passing decades. So, it is highly probable that these growths are expected to go further down for both communities due to easy accessibility of family planning. But, I am going to assume that only ‘Hindu population growth’ is going to decrease at its average decrement rate (Decrement rate is different from growth rate. It means the change of growth rate with time. You can understand it by a simple analogy: If growth rate is velocity of an object, then decrement rate is deceleration of the same object :p ) of around 12% while assuming the ‘Muslim growth rate’ constant at its current average growth rate of nearly 23% (that means 0% decrement rate in Muslim growth). I am doing this; just to see, how early Muslim population can becomes equal to its Hindu counterpart.

The growth equation becomes something like this (it’s in a Geometric Progression form):

$$
\underbrace{96.6 \times [1+(0.17 \times 0.88)] \times [1 + (0.17 \times 0.88^2)] \times \cdots [1+(0.17\times 0.88^x)]}_{\text{Hindu populataion}} = \underbrace{17.2 \times 1.25^x}_{\text{Muslim population}}
$$

Here $$x$$ represent the number of decades and solving this equation by the ‘evergreen’ hit and trial numerical method, the value of $$x$$ comes around 12.

Graph 2: Decade-wise expected population of Hindu and Muslim population 
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 90%; text-align: center;"}

So, this means that after 12 decades from now, i.e. in 2131, Muslim population will become equal to Hindu population in India. So, it can be concluded that there exists a possibility that Muslim population can take over Hindu population in India after 120 years. So, the speculation of Hindu people is justified, right? 

<strong>HELL NO!!</strong>
{: style="text-align: center;"}

This is because while looking at this cross over point, a ‘LITTLE DETAIL’ is being forgotten, which is, according to this growth rate, Indian population will become 4.1 billion from its current value of 1.21 billion. Some of you might be thinking now that – ‘So what, what’s the “biggie” with 4.1 billion’. Well, as it turns out, the “biggie” is that the current United Nations Study [2] about ‘World Population trends and its future’ projects that Indian population is going to get stabilised at only 2.5 billion at the end of 21st century. This means, that we are never going to anywhere near to the 4.1 billion mark, which in turn implies that with current reality, there is not going to be a cross-over point. So, it is impossible for Indian Muslim population to become even equal to Indian Hindu population at any time in future. 

<strong>ANOTHER MYTH BUSTED …!!!</strong>
{: style="text-align: center;"}

So why people feared that there will be a cross-over soon?

I believe that one of the reasons that people think Muslim population will surpass, is when they just observe the decreasing share of Hindus in overall population (as shown in Table 1), but as I have already established that even though it might be true, the inference drawn is fallacious.
Another reason can be that population growth rate of Muslims (represented in Graph 1) is always high as compared to Hindus in every decade, since Indian independence. 

Hmm…..What can be the reason of this mismatched population growth?  
- Economic reasons maybe
- Religious reasons maybe 
- Different Beliefs maybe

Let’s try to analyse. But before analysis, one additional point to observe is that after 1971, Muslim growth rate is also decreasing with passing decades(represented in Graph 1)

### Why Difference in Growth Rate: 

#### Economic reasons:
Economic growth can be a reason for this unusual difference. It is conceivable that poor people tend to have more children as they, generally, lacks proper knowledge and resources required for proper family planning. So, let’s look at the proportion of Indian Hindus and Muslims living below the Tendulkar line (not the “Tendulkar” you are thinking about :P ). This line considers anyone earning less than Rs.22/ day in rural areas and Rs. 32/day in urban areas as poor (which according to me, is modicum as a criteria because Rs. 32/day in a city can consider only extremely poor homeless people as Below Poverty Line (BPL), but let’s keep moving forward with national definitions :P )

{% include 2017-12-25/T3.html %}
Table 3 : Percentage of people below BPL  among their religion[3]
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 90%; text-align: center;"}

First of all, keep in mind that, these percentages are of the religion and not of the total population. It means that the “25.6” value written in the first row above is 25.6% of the 79.8% Hindu population and not 25.6% of total Indian population. Secondly it can be seen from the table that, although the percentage of BPL Muslims is higher than the Hindus, the religion wise population percentage varies highly from rural and urban areas (as shown in Table 3).  So, while Muslims lead by only 1 % in rural areas, they have a high margin of 10% in urban areas. So, since Muslims have a higher proportion of their population under poverty, they tend to lack proper family planning and in turn, have a higher number of children which increases their population. This “Family planning” reason can be, further, strengthened by looking at the contraceptive use between Hindus and Muslims from the 2011 census data, which shows that 16% more Hindu couples uses contraception of total set of Hindu and Muslim women as compared to their Muslim counterparts.

Graph 3: Religion-wise proportion of Contraceptive use [4] 
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 90%; text-align: center;"}

Also, do look at the difference between Hindu and Muslim overall BPL percentages over the years. It has been decreasing. This implies that more Muslims are getting out of poverty with time which, in turn, should mean the Muslim population growth rate should start to decrease, which is indeed the case. So, the **Economic betterment** of Muslims can explain the decrement in the Muslim population growth over the years.  

But, since the overall difference in BPL population is around 4% only in 2011-12, the economic reason cannot be the sole reason for around 8% population growth rate difference. So, let’s try to explore some other plausible reasons.

#### Religious reasons/Beliefs:
As some of you may know that religion wise Muslim men can have 3 wives simultaneously while Hindu men can have the regular 1 (Sorry for the pun :P ). Also, Muslim men practice “Talaq-e-biddat” or more famously known as “Triple Talaq” in which a Muslim man can divorce his wife by just saying the word “Talaq” (meaning divorce in Urdu) three times and no other legal formalities are required. . (Although the Indian Supreme court struck down the practice of having more than 1 wife and triple talaq in 2015 and 2017 respectively, I can use them as explanation as I am talking about the trends before 2011 when these practices were still prevalent in India.) On the other hand, Hindu men do not have any such kind of practice in their religion

So, it can be reasoned that both these practices of more simultaneous marriages and easy divorce lead Muslim men to have more partners as compared to their Hindu parallels. This reason can be strengthened by looking at the study [11] conducted by a group of Princeton University.

Graph 4: Religion-wise average number of wives of childless men [4] 
{: style="color:gray; font-size: 90%; text-align: center;"}

So, it is evident from this data that, on average, Muslim men have more wives than Hindu men. This implies that Muslim men are bound to have more number of children due to more number of wives.

So, till now, it is reasoned that <strong>both Economical and Religious factors</strong> are responsible for high Muslim population growth. 

Let’s look at some other reasons.

Provocations/Distorted Interpretations of Quran:

First of all, I would like to clear what I mean by “Distorted Interpretations of Quran” (Although, it is clear by the wording itself, but still :P ). As you may know that “Quran” is the central religious text of Islam which was revealed by the prophet Muhammad around 600 CE.  Now as many holy books are, the Quran is also written in a format of verses which makes it difficult for a common man to understand and needs to be explained by religious leaders/saints. Here’s where the scope of distorted interpretations enter the picture. 

For example,

You all may have heard of the different terrorist organisations like Taliban, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, etc. and how they justify their actions of brutality based on the verses from Quran. One such verse critically used is this one: “Kill the <strong>idolater</strong> wherever you find them, and capture them, and blockade them, and watch for them at every lookout...” (Quran 9:5). Now if any one listens to this interpretation from any terrorist organisation, (s)he will think that the Quran does preaches violence and Islam is the religion of terrorists. 

But if one tries to look at the political and historical landscape when these sentences were recited by Muhammad, things become a little clear. It is explained by “Kabir Helminski” [9] in his blog post [5] that according to Islamic belief, some verses are universal whereas some verses are specific in nature. In a similar way here, the word “Idolater” did not mean a worshipper of idols but was used in a very specific sense at that time. This verse was revealed at the time when Muhammad and his community were fighting with Meccan “pagans”. At that time, most of the region had embraced Islam and there were some hostile forces which were still fighting the forces of Muhammad. So, as a general commanding his people, he revealed this phrase for people who were waging constant attacks on Islam. It was never meant for peaceful people of other religions, but most people do not read history in such extent, which is why they are easily deceived by terrorist propaganda. I don’t think Muhammad ever thought during his recitation that after 1400 years, people are going to rip each other apart because of the misinterpretation of a verse.

Now, coming back to the main topic of this blog, it is worth mentioning that Hindu people have “Vedas” as their holy books. Although Vedas also need to be interpreted by religious leaders, but since Vedas were written around 12 BC, they did not have a historical war-like landscape as Islam did during its conception stage. So, <strong>it can be seen from these observations that it is relatively easier to deceive Muslim people by changing the interpretations of some specific verses of Quran as compared to the case of Hindus.</strong>

Now, in India, some politicians try to make their vote banks on the basis of religion. Sometimes, a Muslim politician says “In order to fulfil the order of Quran, we have to kill all infidels (other religion people, according to them) and for that we need to increase the Muslim population whereas a Hindu politician says “Muslims are breeding like pigs. Hindus have to increase their population to counter the effect.” So, when both leaders say this, Muslim people are more prone to be influenced to increase their population as compared to Hindu people because the Muslim leader projects that the Quran, itself, is asking them to increase the population, which is not the case in Hindus (as the Hindu leader is not able to use the analogy of ‘Vedas’).

One other factor which can affect the population growth rate is the conversion rate of Muslims into Hindus and Hindus into Muslims, but since there is a shortage of official data about conversion rates, I am not going to discuss it here.

Therefore, distorted interpretation of Quran can also be taken as to play a role in the difference of population growth rate of Hindus and Muslims.

I know, I have bored you with a lot of numbers and different concepts, so without further ado

### Conclusion Time …. !!!
First of all, I would like start by people that “India is never going to be a Muslim Nation.” So, many people can take a breath of relief that Muslims will not be able to hurt Hindus. But, guys, before thinking that, just remember the case of Babri Masjid Demolition [6] of 1992, when thousands of Muslims were killed by Hindu radicals or you can think of the 2002 Gujarat riots [7] which also led to the killing of hundreds of innocent people, mainly Muslims. I have not given these examples to label Hinduism as a violent religion nor I am promoting Islam as the best religion ever, but to make a point that, Hindus are well capable of taking arms into their hands and people should not worry about Hinduism’s future in India. 

Also, it is established that a pool of economic reasons, religion beliefs and distorted interpretations of religious texts are responsible for a bigger Muslim population growth rate as compared to Hindus. But the gap is decreasing due to overall betterment of the life of people.

At the end, I just want to say that all humans have the basic needs of food, clothing and love. Nobody is wired to hate other people in the wombs of their mother. So, we should not let our biases regarding a particular community dictate our behaviour towards them. Because the only way Humanity can save it from extinction in a nuclear powered world is by trying to preach peace among different religions rather than competing among themselves for superiority.
